Title: Bacterial diversity among the phyllowsphere, rhizosphere, and endosphere of the tomato plant.
Project participant(s): Jakob Joachin 


Plant-microbe interaction research is typically done on a single part of the plant microbiome (rhizosphere, phyllosphere, etc.). So, there is an opportunity to study all, or multiple, microbiome parts together to better understand how a plant host is influenced by the whole of its microbes. A first step is to determine what microbes are present within a host and how the taxa present differ based on tissue-type (roots, leaves, etc.). 

Research Objective: Conduct a series of alpha- and beta- diversity metrics via the Phyloseq pipeline in R to assess how bacterial communities differ across tissue types, within an indivual host, and across hosts using the tomato plant.

Research Outcomes and Impacts: It is expected that the different tissue types, akin to different habitats, will harbor distinct microbial communities. Determining what taxa are present could potentially serve future agricultural research and applications; leveraging microbial symbionts for crop yield improvements is an expanding area of study.
